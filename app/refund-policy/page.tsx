      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
        At Hindustani Tongue, we understand that learning a new language can be a challenging process. That’s why we
        strive to provide the highest quality language classes and resources to our students. Our commitment to our
        students includes offering a comprehensive refund policy to ensure they feel confident and satisfied with their
        experience with us.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Cancellation</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
        Hindustani Tongue has implemented a liberal cancellation policy for its students. Certain conditions must be met
        to qualify for cancellations. Cancellations are only possible if the request is made immediately after placing
        the course order. If the enrollment has been communicated to the teacher and the Google classroom process has
        started, the cancellation request may be rejected. If a student has already started the course, cancellation
        requests will not be accepted. In cases where the quality of classes delivered is not satisfactory, a refund can
        be requested.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Refund Policy</h2>

        We offer a 7-day money-back guarantee for all new students. If, for any reason, you are not satisfied with our
        language course within the first 7 days of starting your classes, we will refund the full amount paid for the
        course. Please note that this guarantee only applies to new students and only to their first course with us.
